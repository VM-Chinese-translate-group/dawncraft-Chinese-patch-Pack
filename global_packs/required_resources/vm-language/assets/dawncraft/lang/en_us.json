	"text.dawncraft.quest.intro": "Hail fellow, you're finally awake! Welcome to our world. You must be confused as to why you ended up here and who you're speaking to, no?¶...Well, regardless, I will begin my disquisition, as I do with every adventurer summoned here. ¶You are summoned here to defeat the ender dragon. Fabled beasts like giants, werewolves, and even other dragons started appearing two winters ago, wreaking havoc and disrupting the balance of our realm! Our elders told us that the ender dragon has been blighted by a certain malicious deity, and that both the dragon and the deity must be destroyed to bring peace to our realm. Thus, We call forth your aid, brave adventurer. ¶Obtain at least 12 mystic eyes, use them to locate and open the gateway into the End. A few of these eyes can be crafted... but most are held by powerful entities. We don't know who or where these entities are, but the native inhabitants might have a clue. Look for their guild masters, they are most knowledgeable when it comes to these matters.¶You will need to get stronger, way stronger. The native inhabitants may also teach you different fighting skills - if you treat them well at least. As a general rule of thumb, don't attack or steal from them. They are not a forgetful bunch. They are, however, forgiving, if you pay off your sin through their ledger chest. Also, here, take a spirit orb. Collect 4 of them to upgrade your health or stamina. If you ever see one of my kind, interact with them and prove to them your prowess and intellect, they will surely give you something in return.¶If you ever forget these information, an adventurer told me once that he jotted it down in a place called 'Wiki'? He said a seasoned adventurer will know what it means.¶I wish you well on your journey, my sweeting. Expect tough obstacles and roadblocks ahead, but know that they will only make you stronger. God be with ye.",
