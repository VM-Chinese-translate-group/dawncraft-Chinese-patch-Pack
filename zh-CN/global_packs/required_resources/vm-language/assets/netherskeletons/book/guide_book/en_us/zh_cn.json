All this interest in Balloons leaves you quite lonely, which is definitely understandable.
Luckily, you can craft yourself a friend that you cannot make organically.
By capturing a tiny Bloviator in a bottle, you can get an Angry Cloud Bottle. By feeding this angry little cloud a cookie,
you can make a Happy Cloud Bottle. This happy little cloud can be given a material form by crafting it into a Balloon Buddy:
<NEWLINE>
Apon creation, Balloon Buddies will be assigned a personality. This personality determines the expression and behavior of the Balloon Buddy.
All Balloon Buddies function like a wolf or cat, and can be made to stay, follow or wander. They can be picked up and itemized by sneaking with an open hand.
