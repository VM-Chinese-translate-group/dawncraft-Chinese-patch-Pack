A Badloon is a balloon... turned bad. Whether they became evil due to a curse or they were inflated that way is unknown.
<NEWLINE>
Badloons are hostile mobs that can be found at or above cloud height in all biomes.
<NEWLINE>
Perhaps one of the reasons they are so hostile is due to their fragility - a Badloon only has one heart of health and can be instantly popped by any kind of projectile.
This fear of being popped also explains their complete fear of cacti.
But Badloons have tricks up their single glove when it comes to combat - If there are other mobs nearby, they can pick them up and drop them near targets, making combat difficult.
To make matters worse, any dropped creepers will instantly explode. It's probably best to target Badloons first if there are any other monsters around.

If popped, Badloons may drop up to two Balloon Pieces. These pieces are a crafting ingredient for Balloons, but can also be used to make a copy of this book, if lost, by placing it in a crafting table with a book and a Cloud Block.
